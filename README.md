## CreeperMod

A simple bukkit mod I made a while ago to tweak some gameplay for a server I ran for some friends.

It does two things:

* Prevents creepers from being able to kill a player in one hit if the player has full health and iron armor or better. The player will survive with half a heart and will be immune fall damage that totals to less than 10 damage.
* Punching a tamed horse with nothing in the player's hand will name the horse with its health, speed, and jump height.
